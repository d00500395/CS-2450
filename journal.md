Date - 1.23.25 - Subject: Git note for the future. I learned that it is much easier to start with a remote repository and make a local clone than it is to start with a local repository and try to connect it to a remote repository.

Date - 1.25.25 - Subject: Javascript. I am learning a lot more niche features in Javascript in my Web Application Class. We went over basic Javascript functions and event handlers, which I already knew about for the most part but it is good to have a more thorough overview.

Date - 1.30.30 - Subject: Discrete, Group SE. Discrete math is going very well, I looked over the practice exams today and they seem super easy. My Group for Software Engineering is interesting, talking in class is at an absolute minimum which I am okay with. I do think when we get deeper into the project that we will need some more communication to keep us afloat.

Date - 2.1.25 - Subject: SE-2400. I am really struggling with SE-3400. It is not a hard class but the workload is so high that it makes it really hard to trudge through. Getting there though a little bit at a time.

Date - 2.3.25 - Subject: Javascript. Starting to get a little bit behind in the Javascript concepts I am being taught. I am good with basic functions but once we get into servers and flask it gets a little bit confusing.

Date - 2.5.25 - Subject: CS-2450. I looked at the code for our group project, it is definitely going to be interesting going through the code and figuring out how to build off it.

Date - 2.7.25 - Subject: CS-2450. This semester has been weird so far, all of my classes seem to be in sync in terms of which weeks have more and less homework. The workload is manageable most of the time and then one day I randomly have way more than I have for a while.

Date - 2.10.25 - Subject: Computer Networks. It is really nice how some of the course material in my classes is related enough that I can apply my learnings between the classes. They are also going similar paces.

Date - 2.14.25 - Subject: SE-3400. Working on user research and starting to get our subject ready for brainstorming. We are doing a project related to movie watching and picking the best films for a person or group.

Date - 2.20.25 - Subject: CS-2100. Just had my midterm, I didn't study but I think it went fairly well even so. I also took a midterm for my CS-3200 class, and did the presentation for CS-2450. Glad to be done with midterms and ready for a break this weekend!

Date - 2.24.25 - Subject: Internship. This weekend was really nice, getting back into the flow of things now. Work at my internship has been picking up a ton recently, I have had a lot of tickets and a lot of project requests coming in. I honestly can't keep up. It's good though.

Date - 2.26.25 - Subject: Internship. Today right as I was about to leave at 5, the whole website crashed. We haven't figured out the cause yet, but it has something to do with a plugin being moved or an update with wordpress that changed some default settings. We were able to get it working by reverting the plugins to the state they were in yesterday and storing them in a different location that the website is picking up.
